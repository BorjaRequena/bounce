    "In order to use the library, you will have to clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/BorjaRequena/bounce.git` and install it via `pip install bounce`. In order to edit the source code and adapt it to your particular problems, you may want to install it in editable form with `pip install -e bounce`.\n",

    "In order to perform the installation, you can either provide the full path to the repository or be in the immediately higher level. For instance, if the repository is in the directory `~/what/ever/bounce`, go to `~/what/ever/` directory to run the `pip install -e bounce` command, otherwise you can run `pip install -e ~/what/ever/bounce`. If this ever gets momentum, we'll put it on pypi :)\n",
