<p>In this repository you can find the source code and a set of notebooks providing a thorough example of how to use the library and how to reproduce the figures shown in the paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>The source code can be found in two directories: it is within <code>bounce</code> and in <code>nbs</code> (see the <a href="https://borjarequena.github.io/BOUNCE/">docs</a>). Bounce stands for BOUNd CErtification. This project is based on <a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev">nbdev</a>, which generates the library from notebooks. These contain complementary explanations of the code with small examples. </li>
<li>The <code>examples</code> directory contains a set of notebooks that conform a tutorial of how to use this library, with extended explanations and examples. The examples contain the source code to reproduce the figures from the paper, which can all be plotted in the <code>04_plots.ipynb</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use the library, you will have to clone this repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/BorjaRequena/BOUNCE.git</code> and install it via <code>pip install BOUNCE</code>. In order to edit the source code and adapt it to your particular problems, you may want to install it in editable form with <code>pip install -e BOUNCE</code>.
{% include note.html content='to perform the installation, you can either provide the full path to the repository or be in the immediately higher level. For instance, if the repository is in the directory <code>~/what/ever/BOUNCE</code>, go to <code>~/what/ever/</code> directory to run the <code>pip install -e BOUNCE</code> command, otherwise you can run <code>pip install -e ~/what/ever/BOUNCE</code>.
