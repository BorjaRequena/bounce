In order to edit the source code and adapt it to your particular problems, you may want to install it in editable form with `pip install -e BOUNCE`.\n",

For instance, if the repository is in the directory `~/what/ever/BOUNCE`, go to `~/what/ever/` directory to run the `pip install -e BOUNCE` command, otherwise you can run `pip install -e ~/what/ever/BOUNCE`. If this ever gets momentum, we'll put it on pypi :)\n",
