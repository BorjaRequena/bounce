We have originally developed this library for the paper [**Certificates
of quantum many-body properties assisted by machine
learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03830). Here, you will find the
source code used to obtain the paper results in the
[tutorials](https://borjarequena.github.io/bounce/tutorial/introduction.html).

# Installation

In order to use the library, you will have to clone this repository with
`git clone https://github.com/BorjaRequena/bounce.git` and install it
via `pip install bounce`. In order to edit the source code and adapt it
to your particular problems, you may want to install it in editable form
with `pip install -e bounce`.

> **Note**
>
> In order to perform the installation, you can either provide the full
> path to the repository or be in the immediately higher level. For
> instance, if the repository is in the directory `~/what/ever/bounce`,
> go to `~/what/ever/` directory to run the `pip install -e bounce`
> command, otherwise you can run `pip install -e ~/what/ever/bounce`. If
> this ever gets momentum, we’ll put it on pypi :)
